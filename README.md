Project Title: Lead Scoring for X Education


 Introduction: X Education, an online course provider catering to industry professionals, faces a challenge with its lead conversion process. Despite attracting a substantial number of potential customers, the current lead conversion rate stands at approximately 30%. In an effort to significantly improve this rate, X Education aims to implement a lead scoring model to identify and prioritize high-conversion probability leads, commonly referred to as 'Hot Leads.'


Problem   Statement: The current lead conversion process at X Education involves various stages, from attracting leads through website interactions to engaging with them through calls and emails. However, the conversion rate remains suboptimal. The company wishes to enhance efficiency by developing a lead scoring model that assigns a score to each lead, allowing the sales team to focus efforts on leads with a higher likelihood of conversion.


Objective: The primary objective of this project is to increase the lead conversion rate from the existing 30% to approximately 80%. This will be achieved by implementing a lead scoring system that evaluates and prioritizes leads based on their conversion potential.
